/**
 * Estimates gyroscope cross couplings, scaling factors and
 * G-dependent cross biases introduced on the gyroscope by the specific
 * forces sensed by the accelerometer.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * This calibrator assumes that the IMU is at a more or less fixed location on
 * Earth, and evaluates sequences of measured body kinematics to perform
 * calibration for unknown orientations on those provided sequences.
 * Each provided sequence will be preceded by a static period where mean
 * specific force will be measured to determine gravity (and hence partial
 * body attitude).
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * To use this calibrator at least 7 sequences are needed (each containing
 * at least 3 body kinematics measurements) when common z-axis is assumed and
 * G-dependant cross biases are ignored, otherwise at least 10 sequences are
 * required (each containing at least 3 body kinematics measurements) when
 * common z-axis is not assumed.
 * If G-dependent cross biases are being estimated, then at least 16
 * measurements are needed when common z-axis is assumed, otherwise at least
 * 19 sequences are required (each containing at least 3 body kinematics
 * measurements) when common z-axis is not assumed.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Measured gyroscope angular rates is assumed to follow the model shown below:
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 *     Ωmeas = bg + (I + Mg) * Ωtrue + Gg * ftrue + w
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 * Where:
 * - Ωmeas is the measured gyroscope angular rates. This is a 3x1 vector.
 * - bg is the gyroscope bias. Ideally, on a perfect gyroscope, this should be a
 * 3x1 zero vector.
 * - I is the 3x3 identity matrix.
 * - Mg is the 3x3 matrix containing cross-couplings and scaling factors. Ideally, on
 * a perfect gyroscope, this should be a 3x3 zero matrix.
 * - Ωtrue is ground-truth gyroscope angular rates.
 * - Gg is the G-dependent cross biases introduced by the specific forces sensed
 * by the accelerometer. Ideally, on a perfect gyroscope, this should be a 3x3
 * zero matrix.
 * - ftrue is ground-truth specific force. This is a 3x1 vector.
 * - w is measurement noise. This is a 3x1 vector.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * This calibrator is based on the ideas of
 * David Tedaldi, Alberto Pretto, Emmanuelle Menegatti. A Robust and Easy to
 * Implement Method for IMU Calibration without External Equipments.
