/**
 * Robustly estimates gyroscope cross couplings and scaling factors
 * along with G-dependent cross biases introduced on the gyroscope by the
 * specific forces sensed by the accelerometer using LMedS robust estimator
 * when gyroscope biases are known.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * This calibrator assumes that the IMU is placed flat on a turntable spinning
 * at constant speed, but absolute orientation or position of IMU is unknown.
 * Turntable must rotate fast enough so that Earth rotation effects can be
 * neglected, bus slow enough so that gyroscope readings can be properly made.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * To use this calibrator at least 10 measurements are needed when common
 * z-axis is assumed and G-dependent cross biases are ignored, otherwise
 * at least 13 measurements are required when common z-axis is not assumed.
 * If G-dependent cross biases are being estimated, then at least 19
 * measurements are needed when common z-axis is assumed, otherwise at
 * least 22 measurements are required when common z-axis is not assumed.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Measured gyroscope angular rates is assumed to follow the model shown below:
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 *     立meas = bg + (I + Mg) * 立true + Gg * ftrue + w
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 * Where:
 * - 立meas is the measured gyroscope angular rates. This is a 3x1 vector.
 * - bg is the gyroscope bias. Ideally, on a perfect gyroscope, this should be a
 * 3x1 zero vector.
 * - I is the 3x3 identity matrix.
 * - Mg is the 3x3 matrix containing cross-couplings and scaling factors. Ideally, on
 * a perfect gyroscope, this should be a 3x3 zero matrix.
 * - 立true is ground-truth gyroscope angular rates.
 * - Gg is the G-dependent cross biases introduced by the specific forces sensed
 * by the accelerometer. Ideally, on a perfect gyroscope, this should be a 3x3
 * zero matrix.
 * - ftrue is ground-truth specific force. This is a 3x1 vector.
 * - w is measurement noise. This is a 3x1 vector.
