/**
 * Utility class to handle Android's AltBeacon library coefficients used te determine distance for calibrated devices.
 * AltBeacon uses the following formula to estimate Beacon's distance:
 * d = coefficient1 * ratio^coefficient2 + coefficient3
 *
 * Considered that radio signal propagation follows equation:
 * Pr = Pt * k / d^n,
 * where:
 * - Pr is received signal strength (expressed in mW),
 * - Pt is transmitted signal strength (expressed in mW),
 * - k is equal to k = c / (4 * pi * f), where:
 *      - c is speed of light (which is aproximately 9*10^8 m/s)
 *      - f is the radio link frequency used by the beacon.
 *
 * Hence, considering:
 * ratio = Pr / Pt
 *
 * which is equal to:
 * ratio = k / d^n
 *
 * And isolating d, whe obtain that:
 * d^n = k / ratio
 *
 * d = (k / ratio)^(1/n)
 * d = k^(1/n)*ratio^(-1/n)
 *
 * And thus we can see from this last expression that:
 * coefficient1 = k^(1/n) = (c / (4 * pi * f))^(1/n)
 * coefficient2 = -1/n, where n is the path loss exponent and depends on the
 * environment where the device is used (typically on free space n is equal to
 * 2.0, but can usually range from 1.6 to 1.8 on indoor environments)
 * coefficient3 is a bias term calibrated for each device.
